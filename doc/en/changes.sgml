    <title>Changes</title>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 2.9.0 to 2.9.1</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron can now be run without root's privileges (<link
	    linkend="faq">see FAQ</link>)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added configure's option --with-boot-install .</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Minor change in the PAM code of fcron : may work better on
some systems.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>configure script now uses getpwnam() and getgrnam() instead of
 reading directly /etc/passwd and /etc/group : this makes easier the use of NIS, LDAP,
 etc.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Bug fix : using some "cmd > /dev/stderr" (or stdout) in a script 
used to make fcron send a bogus output mail. (rewrite of the code managing the
output of jobs)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Bug fix : typo error prevented fcrontab to be compiled on some
systems.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Minor bug fix about stdout option.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Minor bug fix : giving fcrontab's option -c a relative path
now works correctly.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 2.1.0 to 2.9.0</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Added some new options to fcron : -y, -o, -l ; and some
fcrontab options : stdout and volatile. All these permit to make fcron run in
foreground, execute all the pending jobs (mainly %-jobs), and return. May be
used, for instance, in a ppp-up script with a dialup connection to update a
software regularly.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Added fcrondyn : this software allows users to dialog
dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon. Currently, it can list jobs of the
user running it (or all jobs for root). In the near future, it should be able to
run a job, change its next time and date of execution, renice a running job,
send a signal to a running job, etc.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>All the documentation has been ported to SGML DocBook.</para>
	    <para>It results on a much better HTML version, which I recommand
you use. It is installed by default in fcron documentation directory (for
instance, on my system :
<filename>/usr/share/doc/fcron-X.X.X/</filename>).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Fcrontab.5 has been updated and improved. Some examples have
been added and some possible use of the different lines and options are
mentioned.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Added option random, which allows an entry run periodically to
be run at a random time in its intervals of execution, instead of being run as
soon as possible.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added some more checks in fileconf.c : allow user to use
hours, days, hourly, daily, etc options only with %-lines : it is ignored if set
for a &-line, which is quite confusing for users who may type, for instance
"&amp;hourly" instead of "%hourly".</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : you can now use arguments in the var EDITOR and
VISUAL.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : fcron used to call sometimes a sleep(-1), which
causes a freeze (no crash, but a very very long sleep :) ) under system using
LIBC5, and maybe on some non-linux systems. It was not causing any problem under
GLIBC2. Thanks go to Nick Pasich.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
	    
    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 2.0.0 to 2.1.0</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>PAM support for fcron and fcrontab (need testing ! - help
would be appreciated).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Fcron now send a mail if a job has noticenotrun set and could
not be run because of a queue full.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Fcron now compiles on AIX (thank you, John A. Parker !), and a
few AIX-only bugs have been fixed, but it may remain some problems to correct.
Please try, and tell me !</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>We now use constants ROOTUID and ROOTGID instead of some
hard-coded "0", and those constants are defined by the configure script (we use
the uid/gid of the name given with the option "--with-root{name|group}"). It
allows fcron to be run on system on which root is not uid/gid 0/0.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>code cleaning.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : setting lavg to (0,0,0) used to make the line be
added in the lavg queue instead of the serial queue (but the lavgs were ignored
anyway).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : fcrontab's "-z" option was not ignoring previous
user's fcrontab version.</para>
	</listitem> 
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : on systems using putenv(), the var HOME, USER and
SHELL wasn't correctly assigned. On system supporting setenv() (which is the
default), the problem did not occur. (thanks go to Evan A. Zacks).</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>


    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 1.1.1 to 2.0.0</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>using SIGUSR2 on fcron makes it print its current schedule on
syslog and toggles on/off the printing of debug info on syslog.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron behavior on serial and lavg queues overflow has changed
: in previous versions, it used to run a job to make room to put a new one. As
it may conduct to a overwhelming of system resources, the new job is now refused
(and not run). An error message is also logged through syslog.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>a mail is now sent if the job exited due to a signal, or if
exit status is non-zero. Read FAQ if you experience problems about that.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added a FAQ.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : a midmonthly job executed after the 15th of the
month used to cause an endless loop. Thanks go to Guy Geens (thanks a lot
!).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : inserting a job in serial queue or running a job
not finished at startup was broken, unless the job was strict(no).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : some 1.1.1 changes used to make fcron impossible
to compile without sendmail (./configure's option "--with-sendmail=no").</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed in sysV boot script : we know specify explicitly the
path to fcron.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : unresolved error used to occur on some system not
defining getopt_long().</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 1.1.0 to 1.1.1</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>security fix : sym link attack against fcrontab. Any user
allowed to use fcrontab used to be able to remove any fcrontab, and potentially
to truncate any file to zero-length (under certain conditions, anyway).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron and fcrontab now have a configuration file : fcron.conf.
It contains the default paths (spool dir, etc) and programs to use (editor,
shell, etc). Thanks to that file, several fcron processes can run simultaneously
if they have a different config (different spool dir and pid file).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added fcron's option "-m" to control the number of serial jobs
which can be executed simultaneously.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added fcron's option "-n" to create a new spool dir.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>command line syntax of fcrontab has changed : you can know use
"user" (after the file name if any) instead of "-u user". It should make
fcrontab a little more intuitive.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>It is now possible to put a user name between the time/date
fields and the shell command of a fcrontab line (for Vixie cron format
compatibility) : it is equivalent to runas(user).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>support of Solaris (and SysV).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>early support of OpenBSD.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>the installation scripts now use nsswitch.conf to detect if a
user or a group exists on the system. That way, naming services (NYS, ldap, etc)
are supported.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>the man page and doc is now installed by default in
$prefix/share/{man|doc} (instead of the previous $prefix/{man|doc}) ($prefix is
generally "/usr").</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : fcron used not to add a serial_sev line to
serial/lavg queue if this line was running, saying "already in serial
queue".</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : a "all" in fcron.allow with no fcron.deny file
was not considered as an allow rule.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 1.0.3 to 1.1.0</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>The binary format of the binary fcrontabs has changed : there
is now no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs when upgrading fcron (but you
need to convert your fcrontabs to the new format once), and this format should
allow extensions without losing any information.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>better management of the errors in load/save fcrontabs
functions.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>the doc is a clearer about @-lines.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>more security tests by fcrontab in the case it is suid root
(but, if possible, it should be suid fcron as it is far more secure).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>we now remove unwanted fcrontabs before loading them in memory
: well, it seems to be more logical like that :)) .</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : using options first with a &-line may have led to
some problems during the first read by fcron (mail send erroneously if
noticenotrun was used, bad set of the first execution's time and date or
immediate execution if bootrun was set : in fact, the line was not recognized as
a new line).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : fcron used not to be able to be compiled from any
directory because of an absent -I. line option for the compiler (the config.h
file was not found).</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 1.0.2 to 1.0.3</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron can now be configured and compiled from any directory
(not only from the source dir).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : fcron now sets umask to the value it got at start
before running a job.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : a bug used to make the "truncated" system not
to work correctly, so a too long log message used to make fcron crash.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 1.0.1 to 1.0.2</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>the user for whom a job is run is now logged.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>installation script is now more explicit about what it is
going to do.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>a boolean value can now also be set by "yes" and "no".</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : bootrun option works again.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : shell variable containing underscore (_) used
to be rejected.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : installation script used not to check if user
fcron was in group fcron, in which case fcrontab doesn't work correctly (it
cannot, in that case, read the fcrontabs for non-privileged users).</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>security fix : a user used to be able to read a file owned by
root if root runs a "fcrontab -u user -e".</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.9.5 to 1.0.0</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added fcron's option "-s" to control the time between two
saves of the fcrontabs on disk.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>installation scripts now support better FreeBSD and sh.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : configure's options prefix and
without-sendmail used not to work.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : installing an fcrontab by "fcrontab file"
wasn't working correctly with a relative path (a path not beginning by a
"/").</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.9.4 to 0.9.5</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>security fix : the jobs of a fcrontab reinstalled by root used
to be run as root (until the next action of the owner on the fcrontab).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added options strict and noticenotrun to tell fcron
respectively if a job should be removed from lavg queue if its execution
interval is exceeded, and if fcron should mail user to report the non-execution
of a job.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added option nolog in order to log only errors (i.e. no
message like "job x started"). This can help to reduce the disk access and save
energy on a laptop, and make the log more readable if some jobs are run very
often.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>better handle of changes of the uids of users in /etc/passwd
(no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron.deny and fcron.allow files are now owned by root (they
used to be owned by user fcron).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added ./configure's option --with-answer-all to be able to use
"make install" in a non-interactive way (can be useful for automatic
installers).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added option --with-rootname and --with-rootgroup to
./configure script for a better support of exotic systems.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected in make install (script user-group) : the script
used not to handle correctly the absence of both useradd and adduser commands.
This script now checks and tries to add a group fcron if necessary.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.9.3 to 0.9.4</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>security improvement : after the (horrible) root exploit found
in version 0.9.3, I decided to improve fcron/fcrontab's security. I've included
some strong (I hope :)) ) tests in fcron to ensure that only root can run
commands as superuser and use option runas. Even an corrupted fcrontab should
not be able to get root's privileges. Pretty reassuring, isn't it ?</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>runfreq(1) lines have been replaced and extended by a new kind
of line : the lines beginning by a "%". It's now possible to tell fcron to run a
command once an hour, a week, etc, but only at some specified moments. For
instance : '%weekly * 4-7 echo "foo"' will run the command 'echo "foo"' once a
week between 4 and 7 in the morning. (see "man 5 fcrontab" for more
details).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>installation process improved : user is now consulted before
anything is done about installation in boot scripts, etc. The default username
of fcron is now ... fcron ! (this is more secure than daemon, which can be used
by other programs). </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron now adds the host name to the addresses of the mails it
sends.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcrontab determines the identity of the running user by his
uid (it used to use the var USER). That way, fcrontab should act as crontab
under a "su".</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : a tmp file was not removed after a "fcron
-z"</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed in fcrontab : an expression of the form "start-stop"
with start > stop used to be incorrectly managed by fcron.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : when fcron and fcrontab were installed under a
non-privileged user rights, a normal user used to be not able to use
fcrontab.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : while fcrontab was asking user if he would like to
correct an erroneous line, the answer was not correctly handled.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.9.2.1 to 0.9.3</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>installation scripts improved.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>added code to avoid infinite loops.</para>

	<listitem>
	    <para>bugs corrected in the functions to set the time and date of
next execution.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected in the check for invalid lines.</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.9.1 to 0.9.2</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron now uses autoconf (the configure script), so it should
be easier to compile and install it and various systems.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>support of lavg options for all systems where getloadavg() is
defined (BSD unix, etc) and on Linux systems with a proc filesystem (fcron can
use /proc/loadavg).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>a job can now be executed several times simultaneously if
option exesev is set to 1.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>user can determine if a job can be put several times in the
serial queue simultaneously thanks to option serialonce.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron does not wait anymore for the completion of all jobs of
a file before deleting it from memory.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron handles correctly the jobs which are both serial and
lavg.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron now runs under a specific user and group (other than
root) for basic security reasons.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : fcron used to crash after a file was deleted
from memory in some conditions.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>corrected the bug which used to appear when a line was put
several times in the serial queue : in this case, fcron used not to count
correctly the number of running serial jobs.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : fcrontab used not to remove the temporary file
it creates if no modification where done to a file after an edition using the -e
option and on errors.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : fcrontab now defines correctly the remain
value of a line based on time and date beginning with a "&" but without runfreq
definition.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : fcron used to not install correctly a file
edited if a correction was made.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : reset option was not working correctly when
set to a single line.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.9.0 to 0.9.1</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>support of the option mailto for each line (it used to be set
for the whole file).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>the value of the runas and mailto options are now stored
internally as a uid number : you must reinstall all the system's fcrontabs if
you change the uid of a user.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Support of options "lavg*", in order to run a job under a
specific 1, 5 and/or 15 minutes system load average value(s). When the job
should be run, it is placed in a specific queue and the load average is checked
regularly until the right value(s) is/are got. The options "lavgor" and
"lavgand" permits users to tell fcron if they prefer to perform a logic OR or
AND between the 1, 5 and 15 load average values. The option "until" can be use
to force the execution of a job after a determined timeout if the right
conditions to run the job are not filled.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>fcron now uses putenv() in place of setenv() (setenv() is not
POSIX compliant).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>a mailto option set to "" is now equivalent to
"mail(false)".</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>corrected the bug which used to make a bootrun and runfreq(1)
job executed twice when fcron's start occurs in an interval of execution of the
job.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>corrected the bug which used to make fcron crash after
serial_array is resized.</para>
	</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
	<title>From version 0.8.3 to 0.9.0</title>
	<listitem>
	    <para>support of options in fcrontabs. Options can be specific to a
line or defined once for every line located after their definition (a special
option "reset" set all options to their default). Some options also have too
names: a long name and an abbreviation.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>jobs can now be run be run one after the other (option
"serial") : when the job should normally be run, it is added to a queue, which
entries are executed one by one. It permits to avoid the use of a lot of system
resources for a brief moment by the simultaneous execution of several
tasks.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>jobs can be run at system start up if they should have been
run during system down time (option "bootrun").</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>root can run jobs as an another user (option "runas")</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>user can set a nice value to a job, but only root can use a
negative value (a negative value will increase priority)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>user can choose to perform a logic AND or a logic OR between
day of month and day of week (option "dayor" and "dayand")</para>
	</listitem>

before :-) ...</para>
