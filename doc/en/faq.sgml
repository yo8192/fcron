	    <question>
		<para>How does fcron handle system clock adjustments (daylight
savings, etc) ?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
       First, you must understand that fcron determines, for each job, its next
time and date of execution. It then determines which of those jobs would be the
next to run and then, sleeps until that job should be run. In other words, fcron
doesn't wake up like Vixie cron each minute to check all job in case one should
be run ... and it avoids some problems associated with clock adjusts.</para>
		<para>
       This means that if the new time value is set into the past, fcron won't
run a particular job again. For instance, suppose the real time and system clock
are 3:00, so the next job cannot be scheduled to run before 3:00, as it would
have already been run and re-scheduled.</para>
		<para>
       First, suppose you set your system clock into the past, say to 2:00,
Presuming that the last run was shortly before 3:00. then fcron will sleep until
the next job should be executed. The execution time for a job is determined by
identifying the last time that the job ran and computing the next scheduled
time. This means that the next scheduled time must be on or after 3:01.
Therefore, in this example, fcron will not run a job for at least one
hour.</para>
		<para>
       Next, if you set the system time into the future, say to 4:00, fcron will
run every job scheduled between the old and the new time value once, regardless
of how many times it would have been scheduled. When fcron wakes up to run a job
after the time value has changed, it runs all the jobs which should have run
during the interval because they are scheduled to run in a past time.</para>
		<para>
       As special case is when "@xxx" style scheduling rules are involved, you
must consider the "adjustment-interval". The "adjustment-interval" is the time
difference between the original system time and the new system time. If the ...
<!-- I need some help here.  What would happen? --> run at "adjust-interval" too
early or too late depending of the nature of the adjust.</para>
		<para>
       To conclude, fcron behaves quite well for small clock adjusts. Each job
which should have run does so once, but not exactly at the correct time as if
the job were scheduled within the adjustment interval. But, if you have to make
a big change in the time and date, you should probably reset all the scheduled
"nextexe" by running "fcrontab -z" on all the fcrontabs.</para>

	    <question>
		<para>How can I prevent fcrontab from considering the first
"word" of my command line as a user name i.e. "runas(word)" ?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
      Suppose you have an user called "echo" (weird idea ... :)) ). If you use
the line '* * * * * echo "Hello !"' in root's fcrontab, "echo" will be
interpreted as "runas(echo)".</para>
		<para>To suppress that, put your command in quotes :
<programlisting>* * * * * 'echo "Hello !"'</programlisting> will work as
expected as quotes are allowed for the shell command but not for the user
name.</para>

	    <question>
		<para>
       I have a job which usually terminates with a non-zero status. When it
does, I receive a mail with the exit status even if the command had no output.
How can I avoid the mail?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
      You could disable mail entirely by setting the "mail" option to "no". But,
if you still want to receive the standard output as mail, you can add an command
which always evaluates to 0, like "/bin/true", after your primary command. This
will not affect your job nor create additional output. For example:</para>
		<programlisting>* * * * * /a/non/zero/status/job ;
/bin/true</programlisting>

	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	    <question>
		<para>What does "loadavg" mean anyway?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
      The "/proc/loadavg" file provides loadavg values. These values are (in
order): the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes; a count of
the (active tasks/active processes); the pid of last process run;
		</para>
		<para>
      The active task count includes those processes marked as running or
uninterruptable. A load average is an estimate of the average number of
processes running within a specified period. The load averages are computed from
active task count. They are updated each time active task counts are taken.
		</para>
		<para>
<!-- It sure would be nice for some MathML here. --> <programlisting> The load
average formula is: loadavg(d,n) = active_task_cnt - (active_task_cnt -
old_loadavg)*(1/exp(d/n); where: d is the time interval between active task
count readings, typically every 5 seconds. n is the time over which the readings
are averaged. </programlisting>

	    <question>
		<para>How can I use fcrontab in scripts ?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
      You can use pipes with "<command>fcrontab -l</command>" (list the
fcrontab) and "<command>fcrontab -</command>" (read the new fcrontab from
input). For example : </para>
		<screen><command>echo -e "`fcrontab -l | grep -v exim`\n0 * * *
*	/usr/sbin/exim -q" | fcrontab -</command></screen>
		<para>
		  can be used to add a line. Another way to do it would be to:
list the fcrontab settings into a temporary file ("<command>fcrontab -l >
tmpfile</command>"); modify the temporary file ("<command>echo $LINE >>
tmpfile</command>"); replace the original fcrontab by the temporary; and
finally, remove the temporary file ("<command>fcrontab tmpfile ; rm -f
tmpfile</command>").
		</para>
	    </answer>

	<qandaentry>
	    <question>
		<para>Can I use fcron from time to time, for instance in a
script ?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>Let's suppose you use fcron in your ppp-up script. Fcron
can permit you to run some jobs at connection startup, but not at each
connection, like it would be if the job was run directly by the ppp-up script :
for instance, only once every week.</para>
		<para><example>
			<title>Using fcron in a script : running a job once
every day, week, etc, at dialup connection</title>
			<para>You can use a script like :</para>
			<programlisting>
# A ppp-up script ... # run the jobs pending, then returns : fcron -f -y -o
</programlisting>
			<para>in conjunction with a fcrontab file like :</para>
			<programlisting>
# a fcrontab file ... %random(no),weekly,stdout * *
/a/command/to/download/latest/mozilla/release %monthly,stdout * * *
/update/junkbuster/config/files
</programlisting>
		    </example></para>
		<para>You can also use fcron to run some jobs until the end of
the connection. For instance, you can make fetchmail retrieve mails more often
during connection : we suppose that it is configured to retrieve mails every
hours, which launches a dialup connection if necessary, and we want it to check
for mails every 5 minutes while connected.</para>
		<para><example>
			<title>Using fcron in a script : running a job until the
end of the connection</title>
			<para>ppp-up script :</para>
			<programlisting>
# A ppp-up script ... # run fcron at the beginning of the connection : fcron -b
</programlisting>
			<para>ppp-down script :</para>
			<programlisting>
# A ppp-down script ... # stop fcron at the end of the connection : # -- Warning
: killall may have unwanted effect on non linux systems -- killall -TERM fcron
</programlisting>
			<para>the fcrontab :</para>
			<programlisting>
# a fcrontab file ... @volatile,first(0) 5 fetchmail
</programlisting>
		    </example></para>

		<para>If you run fcron in several scripts, or if you run fcron
as a daemon and want also to run fcron in scripts, then you should use fcron,
fcrontab and fcrondyn's <option>--configfile</option>.</para>
		<para>For more details, see fcron's options
<option>--once</option>, <option>--nosyslog</option>,
<option>--firstsleep</option> and <option>--configfile</option> in <link
linkend="fcron.8">&fcron;(8)</link>, and fcrontab's options &optvolatile;,
&optstdout;, &optfirst; in <link
linkend="fcrontab.5">&fcrontab;(5)</link></para>

	<qandaentry>
	    <question>
		<para>Can I run fcron without root's privileges ?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>Yes, you can. To do that, see the
following instructions, but please note that fcrondyn currently does *not* work
without root privileges.</para>
		<orderedlist>
		    <listitem>
			<para>First, create a directory where you'll install fcron,
 and some subdirectories :</para>
			<screen><prompt>bash$
</prompt> <command>mkdir /home/thib/fcron</command>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>cd /home/thib/fcron</command>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <command>mkdir doc man spool</command></screen>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
			<para>Then, run configure with option 
<option>--with-run-non-privileged</option>, set all user names and groups to yours,
and set appropriately the paths :</para>
			<para><warning>
			    <para>This option allows a non privileged user to run
	fcron. When used, fcron does not change its rights before running a job
	(i.e., if joe runs fcron, every job will run as joe).  It means that
	<emphasis>YOU SHOULD NOT RUN FCRON AS A PRIVILEGED USER WHEN COMPILED
	WITH THIS OPTION</emphasis> or you'll have a serious security
	hole.</para> </warning></para>
			<screen><prompt>bash$
</prompt> <command>./configure --with-run-non-privileged --with-rootname=thib
--with-rootgroup=thib --with-username=thib --with-groupname=thib
--with-etcdir=/home/thib/fcron --with-piddir=/home/thib/fcron
--with-fifodir=/home/thib/fcron --with-spooldir=/home/thib/fcron/spool
--with-docdir=/home/thib/fcron/doc --prefix=/home/thib/fcron</command></screen>
		    </listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>The rest of the installation is described in the
<link linkend="install">install file</link>.</para>
