	<title>Description</title>
	<para>A &fcrontabf; is a file containing all tables used by the
&fcron;(8) daemon. In other words, it is the means for a user to tell the daemon
"execute this command at this moment". Each user has his own &fcrontabf;, whose
commands are executed as his owner (only root can run a job as another using the
option &optrunas; (see below)).</para>
	<para>Blank lines, line beginning by a pound-sign (#) (which are
considered comments), leading blanks and tabs are ignored. Each line in a
fcrontab file can be either</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
		<para>an environment setting,</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
		<para>an option setting,</para>

	    <listitem>
		<para>entries based on elapsed system up time,</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
		<para>entries based on absolut time (like normal crontab
entries), or</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
		<para>entries run periodically.</para>
	    </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>Any logical line (an entry or an assignment) can be divided into
several real lines (the lines which end by a newline character) by placing a
backslash (\) before the newline character (\n).</para>

	<refsect2>
	    <title>The environment settings</title>
	    <para>The environment settings are of the form</para>
	    <blockquote>
		<para>name = value</para>
	    </blockquote>
	    <para>where the blanks around equal-sign (=) are ignored and
optional. Trailing blanks are also ignored, but you can place the value in
quotes (simple or double, but matching) to preserve any blanks in the
value.</para>
	    <para>When &fcron; executes a command, it always sets
<envar>USER</envar>, <envar>HOME</envar>, and <envar>SHELL</envar> as defined in
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> for the owner of the &fcrontabf; from which the
command is extracted. <envar>HOME</envar> and <envar>SHELL</envar> may be
overridden by settings in the &fcrontabf;, but <envar>USER</envar> may not.
Every other environment assignments defined in the user &fcrontabf; are then
made, and the command is executed.</para>
	    <para>Plus, the special variable <varname>MAILTO</varname> allows
you to tell &fcron; to whom it has to mail the command's output. Note that
<varname>MAILTO</varname> is in fact equivalent to a global declaration of the
option &optmailto; (see below). It is only used for backward compatibility, so
you should use the option &optmailto; directly.
</para>

	    <title>Entries based on elapsed system up time</title>
	    <para>The entries of commands which have to be run once every m
minutes of &fcron;'s execution (which is normally the same as m minutes of
system's execution) are of the form</para>
	    <programlisting>@options frequency command</programlisting>
	    <para>where frequency is a time value of the form
value*multiplier+value*multiplier+...+value-in-minutes as "12h02" or "3w2d5h1".
The first means "12 hours and 2 minutes of fcron execution" while the second
means "3 weeks, 2 days, 5 hours and 1 minute of fcron execution". The only valid
multipliers are:</para>

	    <para>In place of <replaceable>options</replaceable>, user can put a
time value : it will be interpreted as
<token>@first(<replaceable>time</replaceable>)</token>. If &optfirst; option is
not set, the value of "<varname>frequency</varname>" is used.</para>
	    <para>This kind of entry does not guarantee a time and date of
execution (as the job is delayed at each startup by the time elapsed since the
shutdown), but should be useful for jobs depending on the number of things done
by the users (for instance, the filesystem should better be checked after a
certain amount of use by the users rather than every x days, as the system may
run from 1 day to x days during that x days interval).</para>
	    <para>The time remaining before next execution is saved every &save;
seconds (to limit damages caused by a crash) and when &fcron; exits after having
received a <constant>SIGTERM</constant> signal, i.e. when systems go down. Thus,
this kind of entries is particularly useful for systems that don't run
regularly. The syntax being very simple, it may also useful for tasks which
don't need to be run at a specific time and date.</para>

&optserial;, &optlavg;, &optnice;, &optrunas; (see below).</para>

	    <para>The second type of &fcrontabf;'s entries begins by an optional
"&", which can be immediately followed by an optional number defining the
frequency of execution (this is equivalent to option &optrunfreq;) or a
declaration of options; it has five time and date fields, and a shell command
:</para>

	    <para>Note that the shell command may be preceded by a user name,
which is equivalent to <token>runas(<replaceable>user</replaceable>)</token>: as
it is only here for backward compatibility you should use option &optrunas; (see
below) instead. The frequency is interpreted as: "run this command after x
matches of time and date fields". The time and date fields are:</para>

	    <para>A field is always filled by either an asterisk (*), which acts
as "<token>first-last</token>" range, a single number or a list.</para>
	    <para>List are numbers or range separated with commas (,). For
instance: "2,5,15,23".</para>
	    <para>Ranges of number are of the form
"<token><replaceable>begin</replaceable>-<replaceable>end</replaceable></token>", 
where "<replaceable>begin</replaceable>" and "<replaceable>end</replaceable>"
are included. For example, "3-5" specifies the values 3, 4 and 5. You can also
add an optional "/<replaceable>number</replaceable>" to a range, where the
<replaceable>number</replaceable> specifies skips of the
<replaceable>number</replaceable>'s value through the range. For example,
"0-23/2" can be used in the hours field to specify command execution every other
hour. Finally, one or several "~<replaceable>number</replaceable>" can be added
to turn off some values in a range. For example, "5-8~6~7" is equivalent to
"5,8". The final form of a field is:</para>
	    <blockquote>
		<para>a[-b[/c][~d][~e][...]][,f[-g[/h][~i][~j][...]]][,...]</para>
	    </blockquote>
	    <para>where the letters are integers.</para>
	    <para>You can also use an asterisk (*) in a field. It acts for
"<token>first-last</token>". For example, a "*" in the field minute means all
minutes from minute 0 down to minute 59.</para>
	    <para>Ranges can be included in a list as a single number. For
instance: "2,5-10/2~6,15,20-25,30".</para>
	    <para>Names can also be used for the "month" and "day of week"
fields. To do so, use the first three letters of the particular day or month
(case doesn't matter). Please note that names are used exactly as numbers: you
can use them in a list or a range.</para>
	    <para>If a day of month and a day of week are given, the command
will execute only when <emphasis>both</emphasis> match with the current time and
date unless option &optdayor; is set. For example, with the line
<programlisting>5 10 31 * 7 echo ''</programlisting> echo will only be executed
days which are a Sunday AND a 31th, at 10:05.</para>

			</simplelist></para>
		    <para>Those keywords tell &fcron; to run the command
once from the beginning of the corresponding time interval to the end of that
time interval. A time interval is, for example, the time from Monday 16:20 to Wednesday 01h43.
For instance, the keyword <parameter>weekly</parameter> tells &fcron;
to run a command once between Monday and Sunday each week.</para>
	    <para>With this two kind of keywords, user must give the needed time
fields (as defined in "<link linkend="fcrontab.5.tadent">Entries based on time

that the time intervals are defined from middle to middle of the corresponding
"*ly" intervals : <parameter>midweekly</parameter> will run a command once from
Thursday to Wednesday. Note that <parameter>nightly</parameter> is equivalent to
<parameter>middaily</parameter>.</para>

	    <para>Those keywords act differently, as
follows:</para>
	    <para>run this command once during EACH time interval specified, ignoring
the fields below the keyword in the time interval definition (a
<parameter>hours</parameter> prevents the mins field to be considered as a time
interval, but it will be used to determine when the line should be run during an
interval : see the note below) (<parameter>dow</parameter> means "day of
week").</para>
	    <para>Such a keyword is followed by 5 time and date fields (the same
fields used for a <link linkend="fcrontab.5.tadent">line based on absolute
time</link> (see above)). Furthermore, there must be some non-matching time and
dates in the lines with that kind of keyword (i.e. the following is not allowed
: <programlisting>%hours * 0-23 * * * echo "INCORRECT line !"</programlisting>
but <programlisting>%hours * 0-22 * * * echo "Ok."</programlisting> is
allowed).</para>

		<para>But all fields below the keywords are ignored in time

"no" or 0 to mean <constant>false</constant>. See above for explanations about
time value (section <link linkend="uptent">"entries based on elapsed system up
time"</link>).</para>
	    <para>Note that <varname>dayand</varname> and
<varname>dayor</varname> are in fact the same option : a false value to
<varname>dayand</varname> is equivalent to a true to <varname>dayor</varname>,
and reciprocally a false value to <varname>dayor</varname> is equivalent a true
value to <varname>dayand</varname>. It is the same for
<varname>lavgand</varname> and <varname>lavgor</varname>.</para>
	    <para>Note a special case to be handled : A job should be entered
into the serial queue, *but* the previous entry for this job has not been
completed yet, because of high system load or some external event. Option
<varname>serialonce</varname> answers the question : should the new entry of the
job be ignored ? This way one can distinguish between jobs required to run a
certain number of times, preferably at specified times, and tasks to be
performed irrespective of their number (-> serialonce(true)), which make the
system respond faster.</para>
	    <para>The same considerations apply for the load average queue, and
can be expressed with option <varname>lavgonce</varname>.</para>
	    <para>Moreover, if the serial or the lavg queue contains
respectively more than &serialqueuemax; and &lavgqueuemax; jobs, any new job is
refused and not run to avoid an overwhelming of system resources. In this case,
an error message is logged through syslog.</para>
	    <para>Finally, if jobs remain in the lavg or serial queues when
fcron stops, they will be put once in the corresponding queue on startup (their
order may not be conserved).</para>
