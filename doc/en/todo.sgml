	 <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some
		  modules (.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it
		  calls a function of the module, and let it manage the job
		  (threads ?). (do linux dlopen(), etc exist on other systems ?
		  - yes : thanks Harring ;) dlopen exists on all POSIX system -
		  even windoze - abait it does not use the same insterface of
		  function calls. But it can be easily implemented to port to
		  another system.).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>(related to the system of modules ? create a kind of
		  dependencies ?)  Add a way to run a job only if a command
		  returns true. It would permit, for instance, to run some jobs
		  on a laptop only if it is on AC power.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>add a system of data flow</para>

	    <listitem>
	       <para>Add a way to stop a job (SIGSTOP) if the lavg gets to high,
		  and restart it (SIGCONT) when the lavg has decreased.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Add a timeout for task completion : if a task takes more
		  than a specified timeout, then start another script with the
		  initial task PID as argument.  That would allow a kill with
		  different signals (-HUP, -TERM -STOP, .... or any other action
		  like sending a mail to sysadmin to alert him/her that a task
		  is taking too much time and that he has to have a look at it.)
		  (add an option to specify the cmd, and combine w/ option until)
